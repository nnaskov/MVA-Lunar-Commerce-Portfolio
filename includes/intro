<h1 id='introduction'>Introduction</h1>
<p>This document, called the <strong>Lunar Commerce Portfolio</strong>, aims to discuss, categorize, and to the extent possible, quantify the potential lunar commercial markets in both an early phase and a longer-term mature phase.</p>

<p>This document is devised in two main sections:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Early Phase</strong> - characterized with no or minimal human presence on the Moon, which is depended on supplies from Earth and governments are the customer for the vast majority of the lunar business</li>
<li><strong>Mature Phase</strong> - characterized with a permanent human presence on the Moon, which is totally sustained by the Moonâ€™s resources, and not dependent on a logistical supply chain of deliveries from Earth. Both commercial customers and providers operate on the Moon, possibly even using lunar currency</li>
</ol>
