# Introduction

This document, called the **Lunar Commerce Portfolio**, aims to discuss, categorize, and to the extent possible, quantify the potential lunar commercial markets in both an early phase and a longer-term mature phase.

This document is devised in two main sections:

1. **Early Phase** - characterized with no or minimal human presence on the Moon, which is depended on supplies from Earth and governments are the customer for the vast majority of the lunar business
2. **Mature Phase** - characterized with a permanent human presence on the Moon, which is totally sustained by the Moonâ€™s resources, and not dependent on a logistical supply chain of deliveries from Earth. Both commercial customers and providers operate on the Moon, possibly even using lunar currency
